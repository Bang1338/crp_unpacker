# crp_unpacker
for iOS users that came to Windows

# what is crp file?
crp file actually is tar file, exist on the game called Cookie Run: Ovenbreak

i datamined by using Filza, and transfer that file using WebDav (default is 192.168.1.38:11111)

# how to use
put .crp file in the folder (bundle_ccp.crp, bundle_image.crp and bundle_map.crp)

run the script and done.

# Issues
if you put only one file (except bundle_map.crp) it's still unpacked but it's said error

check the folder if the folder called "ccp" and/or "image" exist

i'll fix that later.
